Manage your Discord server's webhooks via Slash Commands

---
### Why?
As of right now, you can't manage Discord webhooks on mobile. I main reason I built this was so I could configure my webhook settings from my Discord mobile client.
### How?
I used [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) to interact with the Discord API.
